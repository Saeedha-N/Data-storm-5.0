## Overview
### Background To The Business

KJ Marketing is a leading retail supermarket chain in Sri Lanka, with a network of outlets across both urban and suburban areas. They offer an extensive selection of products, including dry goods, fresh items, and luxury products, catering directly to end consumers.

### Background To The Problem

The company has recently identified that during the past few years using conventional and standard marketing strategies has not been effective to their current customer base. Therefore, in an effort to enhance its marketing strategies, the company is interested in adopting a personalized marketing strategy tailored to individual customer preferences. To support this initiative, they have provided you with historical sales data, which includes average monthly sales per customer. You are tasked with developing a sophisticated analytical method to identify groups of similar customers based on this data.

The company operates 22 outlets located in both urban and suburban regions, offering a diverse range of products spanning dry goods, fresh produce, and luxury items.

**Dry items** typically refer to non-perishable goods that do not require refrigeration or freezing to maintain their quality and safety. These items can include a wide range of products such as grains, cereals, pasta, canned goods, snacks, baking ingredients, spices, condiments, and beverages like coffee and tea. They are called ”dry” because they do not contain high levels of moisture and can be stored at room temperature for extended periods without spoiling.

**Fresh items** refer to perishable goods that have a limited shelf life and require refrigeration or special storage conditions to maintain their quality and safety. These items typically include fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meat, poultry, seafood, and bakery items like bread and pastries. Fresh items are valued for their nutritional content, flavor, and texture, and they are often purchased for immediate consumption or use within a few days. Maintaining the freshness of these items is crucial to ensure they meet consumer expect.

**Luxury items** items are high-end products that are characterized by their premium quality, exclusivity, and often higher price point compared to standard or mass-market alternatives. These items are typically associated with superior craftsmanship, exceptional materials, unique designs, and prestigious brand names. Luxury items can span across various categories including fashion, accessories, jewelry, watches, electronics, pet foods , automobiles, home goods, and gourmet food and beverages.

Consumers are drawn to luxury items for various reasons, including their perceived status symbol, exceptional performance or functionality, exquisite aesthetics, and the overall experience they offer. Owning luxury items can signify wealth, sophistication, and discerning taste, making them desirable to individuals seeking to indulge in a higher standard of living or express their personal style and identifications and health standards.

Through an initial analysis, **6 customer segments** of customers were identified. Your task is to classify the new customer to relevant customer segments.
